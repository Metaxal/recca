# RECCA


Framework for Reversible Energy-Conservative Cellular Automata.

This is a CA framework to design various kinds of CAs, where it is easy to design reversible ones.

## Running locally

```shell
javac *.java
jar cf recca.jar *.class wogs
appletviewer file:path/to/RECCA.html
```

The last command can be substituted by opening RECCA.html in a browser with Java enabled (which is in general not recommended though).
